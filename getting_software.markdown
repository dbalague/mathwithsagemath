Since we will be working with a whole bunch of different tools, it is important to have them installed and ready.

I will update the list of software I will be using in my posts.

- [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) (Multiplatform Computer Algebra System) This is the main "software" that we will be using. The current version is based on Python 3 (older versions were based on Python 2). If you know Python, you will probably enjoy working with SageMath. You can use your Python knowledge to your advantage.
    - [SageMath Reference Manual](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/index.html)
<p></p>

- [TeXLive](https://tug.org/texlive/) (Multiplatform LaTeX distribution) This is my choice of LaTeX distribution. If using Mac, try [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/). There are other LaTeX distributions. For example, [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) (which is also multiplatform).

- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode--Multiplatform code editor). One can use VSCode for editing LaTeX documents and for running Jupyter Notebooks within the same editor. It is particularly useful when using the package SageTeX (included with SageMath) for using SageMath code inside a LaTeX Document.

- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) (Document converter). This software is particularly useful, for example, for converting our work in SageMath to a LaTeX document.

I also like working with containers and I might write a few posts about using SageMath in containers. I have my own SageMath Docker container setup with the software above (except for Visual Studio Code) that I will probably share in the future. My Binder for this project uses this container.
