I"B<p>During my time at CWRU I learned to use SageMath for my Calculus III class (Vector Calculus). Then I decided to use it for my Introduction to Differential Equations class.</p>

<p>I will share what I learned with you. I will post the corresponding code on a Binder (I will set the link when I have everything ready) so that you can play with the code, download it, and adapt it to your needs.</p>

<p>I hope you find it interesting and helpful!</p>
